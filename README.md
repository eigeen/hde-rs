# HDE-rs

English | [中文](README_zh-CN.md)

HDE-rs is a Rust implementation library of the Hacker Disassembler Engine (HDE), which is a lightweight and high-performance disassembler library for x86 and x86-64 architectures.

HDE-rs provides a Rust-style API wrapper, and optional raw bindings.

**The project is still in WIP. The wrapper API is not stable yet. Please wait for the stable release.**

## Features

- `hde-sys`: Export hde-sys raw bindings to use raw FFI APIs.
